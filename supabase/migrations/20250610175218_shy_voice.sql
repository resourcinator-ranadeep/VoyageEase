  # Fix infinite recursion in users table RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policies on users table cause infinite recursion
    - Policies that check user role by querying users table create circular dependency
    - This prevents user profile fetching and authentication

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create new simplified policies that avoid recursion
    - Use auth.uid() directly without role-based checks for basic operations
    - Create separate admin policies that don't cause recursion

  3. Security
    - Users can view and update their own profiles
    - Admin operations will be handled at application level
    - Enable RLS remains active for security
